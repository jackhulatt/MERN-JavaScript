# Middleware

Middleware is some software module that facilitates some operations and/or communication between other software modules. In Express, middleware functions are commonly used which have access to:

- the request object
- the response object
- the next middleware function in the app's request-response cycle

## Applying middleware in Express

Express applications are built up using a series of middleware function calls to handle the request-response cycle. This middleware may be of any of the following:

- application-level
- router-level
- error-handling
- built-in
- third-party

### Application-level middleware

Application-level middleware is bound to an express application instance using the `app.use()` and `app.METHOD()` functions.

When creating a route in the application, a callback is specified as middleware to the relevant `app.METHOD()` function:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('GET');
});
```

This piece of middleware is called when a request is sent to the root path, '/'. 

Usually, we also specify a third parameter in middleware functions, next, which represents a callback function of middleware to call after this function is done. For example, to create a piece of middleware which logs every request and information about it, we could create the following function:

```js
function logger(req, res, next) {
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.path}`);
    next();
}
```

The `next` parameter must be specified and called, this accepts the next piece of middleware to run in the request-response cycle.

The callback function can then be passed to `app.use()` to specify this is middleware to run on every inbound request:

```js
const express = require('express');

const port = 3000;
const app = express();

function logger(req, res, next) {
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.path}`);
    next();
}

app.use(logger);
```

It is important to consider the order of how middleware is added as middleware added first will run first.

Middleware can also be specified to run on a specified route using `app.use()` as follows:

```js
app.use('/user', logger);
```

This example specifies the `'/user'` path as the first parameter to `app.use()`, the logger is the handler function acting as middleware. The logger function will now only be called on requests to the /user route.

We can also specify multiple callback functions to the app.use() and app.METHOD() functions, for example the following specifies the logger function on the /user route and a callback for what to do:

```js
app.get('/user', logger, (req, res, next) => {
    const page = req.query.page;
    const pageSize = req.query.pageSize;
    const output = `Returning page ${page} consisting of ${pageSize} users`;
    console.log(output);
    next();
}, (req, res, next) => {
    res.send([{"name": "fred123"}]);
});
```

On line 1, the path argument is specified followed by the logger middleware function next. When a request is inbound, the logger middleware will run first, it will then pass control to the callback function (3rd argument) which logs the query parameters for page and pageSize to the Node.js console. The callback then calls next() on line 6 to call the final callback (4th argument) specified on line 7, which sends the response back to the client.

### Router-level middleware

Router-level middleware works like application-level middleware, but is instead bound to an instance of express.Router(). Instead of using the app.use() and app.METHOD() functions to apply middleware, router.use() and router.METHOD() functions are used.

The following example demonstrates using middleware at the router-level:

```js
const express = require('express');

const port = 3000;
const app = express();
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{"id": 1, "name": "fred123"}, {"id": 2, "name": "fred234"}];

function logger(req, res, next) {
    console.log(`${Date()} - ${req.method} ${req.path}`);
    next();
}

// no mount path, executed on every request to the router
router.use(logger);

router.get('/user', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).send(users);
});

router.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
    const id = req.params.id;
    const user = users.find(user => user.id == id);
    if (user) {
        res.status(200).send(user);
        return;
    }
    res.status(404).send(`User with id ${id} not found.`);
});

// mount router
app.use('/', router);

const server = app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server up on ${server.address().address}:${port}`);
});
```

The example allows either a whole collection of users to be returned, or a single user from that collection. The major differences from the application-level examples are:

- line 5: creating an instance of express.Router() 
- line 15,17,21: all use router instead of app to create endpoints
- line 32: mounts the router instance on the express app 

### Error-handling middleware

Error-handling middleware functions like the other middleware functions seen so far, the major difference being that four arguments are required instead of three in the callback functions:

```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).send('Oops, something went wrong...');
});
```

If the err parameter is not specified, the callback will be treated like regular middleware and will not handle errors if used. Ensure the err parameter is specified for error-handling middleware!

Taking lines 31 - 36 from the previous example in Router-level middleware, the above error-handling middleware is usually added to the middleware stack after the router.

```js
// mount router
app.use('/', router);

// error handling if router bindings can't handle request or something else goes wrong
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).send('Oops, something went wrong...');
});

const server = app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server up on ${server.address().address}:${port}`);
});
```

### Built-in middleware

Express includes built-in middleware functions for the most common behaviours in web applications:

- express.static: for serving static assets, i.e., html files, images, etc...
- express.json: for parsing incoming requests with JSON payloads
- express.urlencoded: for parsing incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads

### Third-party middleware

Third-party middleware functions can also be added to Express servers, a list of common middleware exists here: https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html
